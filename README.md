We eat data ðŸ˜‹


## Information

Yata is a fast, simple and easy to use Data Visulaization tool, running on python dash. The main goal of Yata is to provide a easy way for persons with little programming knowledge to visualize their data easily. 


## Version 

##  ``v1.0yata``

This is Yata version 1. No way is it expected to work as we expected, it is the bare bones of the full application, you can test it out to get a general idea of how the script will work!.

## How to install?

I designed yata on existing technologies, as such you will have to get these dependencies by running the yatainstall.sh file.
Just a note, you need python installed. 

A windows version will be coming soon, stay on the look out for that.
